Get some practice in :smiley:

1. Fork this repository.  
2. Copy the resulting git link.
3. `git clone` this fork into your `my-forked-repos` directory (review setup [instructions](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-301d14#create-and-setup-your-301-directory-structure)).  
4. `cd` into this repository.  
5. Immediately `git checkout -b firstname-lastname`
6. `atom .` to open all of the files. There's some new things you haven't seen before. Look around.
6. Open up the `wat.js` file and remove the semicolon from the end of the line and save the file.
7. `git add starter-code wat.js`
8. `git commit -m 'remove semicolon to make the linter fail'`
9. `git push origin test-branch`
10. Head over to GitHub to make a PR from `firstname-lastname`.
